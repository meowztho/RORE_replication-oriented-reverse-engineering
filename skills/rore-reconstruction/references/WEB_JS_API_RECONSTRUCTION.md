# Web / JavaScript / API Reconstruction

Use browser/runtime evidence to connect UI behavior to client logic, requests, responses, storage and navigation.

A useful loop adapted from the reviewed JS methodology is:

```text
Observe → Capture → Reconstruct → Corroborate → Deepen if needed
```

## Observe
Identify the user action, DOM/state change, relevant network request, initiator/call source and candidate scripts/modules. Do not guess an environment before observing it.

## Capture
Acquire the smallest runtime sample that reveals parameter shape, call ordering and state dependencies. Prefer light observation/hooks before disruptive breakpoints when both can answer the question.

## Reconstruct
Connect:

```text
user action
→ DOM/event handler
→ client state / transform
→ request / protocol message
→ response
→ route/render/persistence effect
```

A public OpenAPI/GraphQL/schema source may reveal semantics, but correlate it with actual client/runtime behavior when the claim is target-specific.

## API projection and layer identity

Shared business names or matching sample values do not establish a shared wire contract. An internal/legacy endpoint, frontend projection and public/versioned API may expose the same entity with different field case/names, types, authentication, defaults, validation, request shape or response projection. Bind each captured request/response and schema to its endpoint, version and environment; compare them field by field before carrying a finding across layers. A public schema is evidence about that public API, not automatically about the private client path. Where a field is transformed, trace the client/server mapping or mark the edge unresolved.

## Differential probing
Within authorized scope, manually vary DOM/client state, request shape, method, omitted/extra fields, sequence or version only when it helps distinguish client-side vs server-side logic, validation, derived fields, state transitions or source precedence. Do not escalate impact after the mechanism is understood.

Record what the UI hides relative to the response and what the server recalculates/ignores rather than assuming the client representation is canonical.
